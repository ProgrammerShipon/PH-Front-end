( If Document Object Model is so cool, then why Go with virtual DOM)

#* What is Virtual DOM ?
   # Virtual DOM -
      * Lightweight copy of a DOM Object.
      * Has properties the same as real DOM object. 
      * Make changes in the DOM with the help of the Diff Algorithm
      * It's like: instead of moving actual rooms in a house, you edit the blueprint.

#* Virtual DOM vs Real DOM 
   # Virtual DOM
      * DOM manipulation is very easy 
      * No memory wastage 
      * It updates fast 
      * It can't update HTML directly
      * Update the JSX if the element update 
      * It can produce about 200,000 Virtual DOM Nodes / Second 
      * It is only a virtual representation of the DOM 

   # Real DOM
      * DOM manipulation is very expensive 
      * There is too much memory wastage It updates slow
      * It can directly update HTML
      * Creates a new DOM if the element updates 
      * It allows us to directly target any specific node ( HTML element )
      * It represents the Ul of your application
