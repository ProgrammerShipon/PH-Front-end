# What is Create React app ?
   * Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.

# What is Vite ?
   * Vite is a build tool and development server for modern web development projects, particularly for building and bundling JavaScript-based applications.

   # Vite => 
    * Created by Even you 
    * Written in Go language
    * Pre-bundles dependencies
    * 10 to 100 times faster than Javascript-based bundlers
    * Platform-agnostic: it can develop JS and TS apps with support for React , Svelte, Preact and Vanilla Js


# CRA in development -> 
   * Webpack is used as the entry point (index.js file) and create a tree from all the modules in the project 
   * Transpile the code with Babel
   * Bundles the code together
   * Serves it with the Express web server
   * Sets up sockets that will handle hot module replacement
 # A Significant  Drawback of CRA 
   * Webpack repeats the bundling process every time there is a change in the code . Now think about the performance in large or complex project !!!


# A Significant Advantage of Vite
   * Doesn't rebuild and reload the entire page like CRA
   * Uses route-based code-splitting & determines which part of the code needs to be loaded
   * Uses the browser to parse the native ES modules from the app's entry point 
  # Why Use Vite ?
    * Superior performance 
    * Extensive plugin compatibility
    * Faster updates
    * Faster build time 

# Why are we learning  CRA ?
   * Although Vite is a newer and more advanced tool for building React projects. learning how to use Create React App ( CRA ) can still be valuables for a few reasons.
      * Firstly, many companies and projects still use CRA, so being familiar with it can be useful in terms of collaborating with other developers and working on existing project 
      * Secondly, by learning how to manually set up and configure a project . you can gain a better understanding of the underlying build tools and how they work .
      * Lastly, the skills you learn from using CRA, such as setting up a development environment and managing dependencies , can be applied to a wid range of front-end development projects.
